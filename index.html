<p>
<b>Welcome to IWoR 2018!</b>
</p>


<p>
The goal of the 2nd International Workshop on Refactoring (IWoR 2018) is to provide an informal interactive forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and 

experiences, streamline and foster research on software refactoring, identify some common ground of their work, share lessons and challenges, thereby articulating a vision for 

the future of software refactoring.
</p>

    <h2 id="workshop-summary">Workshop summary</h2>

<p>Successful software products evolve through a process of continuous changes as bugs are fixed,
new features added, and quality issues addressed. Refactoring supports the volatile
software lifecycle by providing better ways to reduce and manage the growing complexity of
software systems while improving developer productivity. Refactoring can be performed at all
levels from requirement specification down to source code level, and, in essence, involves
improving the internal structure of a software artefact without altering its functionality.
In spite of the popularity of refactoring both in practice and as a research topic, many open
questions remain, particularly in terms of understanding how refactoring is performed, measuring
the impact of refactoring, and improving tool support in all areas of refactoring.</p>

    
    <h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h2>

<p>We invite submissions from both academia and industry on any topic that is refactoring
related, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source code refactoring</li>
  <li>Requirement, design and architectural refactoring</li>
  <li>Refactoring of mobile, web and cloud applications</li>

<p>The objective of the 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Refactoring (IWoR 2018)
is to provide an informal interactive forum for researchers and practitioners to
exchange ideas and experiences, streamline and foster research on software refactoring,
identify some common ground for their work, share lessons and challenges, thereby
articulating a vision for the future of software refactoring research.</p>

<p>We solicit four types of submissions: full research papers (max 8 pages), position papers (max 4 pages),
and tool demo papers (max 4 pages), and industrial presentation. Please check the website for more information.</p>

<h2 id="proceedings-and-special-issue">Proceedings and Special Issue</h2>

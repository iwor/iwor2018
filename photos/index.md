## Workshop summary

<p>Successful software products evolve through a process of continuous changes as bugs are fixed,
new features added, and quality issues addressed. Refactoring supports the volatile
software lifecycle by providing better ways to reduce and manage the growing complexity of
software systems while improving developer productivity. Refactoring can be performed at all
levels from requirement specification down to source code level, and, in essence, involves
improving the internal structure of a software artefact without altering its functionality.
In spite of the popularity of refactoring both in practice and as a research topic, many open
questions remain, particularly in terms of understanding how refactoring is performed, measuring
the impact of refactoring, and improving tool support in all areas of refactoring.</p>

------------------------------
The objective of the 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Refactoring (IWoR 2018)
is to provide an informal interactive forum for researchers and practitioners to
exchange ideas and experiences, streamline and foster research on software refactoring,
identify some common ground for their work, share lessons and challenges, thereby
articulating a vision for the future of software refactoring research.

We solicit four types of submissions: full research papers (max 8 pages), position papers (max 4 pages),
and tool demo papers (max 4 pages), and industrial presentation. Please check the website for more information.

## Proceedings and Special Issue
